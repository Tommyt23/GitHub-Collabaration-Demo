# Problem

Let us discuss the formula for compound interest. The formula to calculate compound interest annually is given by: 

A = P(1 + R/100)^t 

Compound Interest = A â€“ P 

Where, 
A is amount 
P is the principal amount 
R is the rate and 
T is the time span

Example: 

Input: Principal (amount): 1200, Time: 2, Rate: 5.4
Output: Compound Interest = 133.099243

# Aim
